**Analysis Goal**
## Plan 
**1. Overview of the data**

**2. Cleaning Data**

**3.Exploring and modeling data**

After data has been thoroughly cleaned, it can then be used to find patterns and values using data visualization tools and charts. This is where machine learning tools come into play. Using algorithms such as classification accuracy, confusion matrix, logarithmic loss, and others, you can find patterns and apply specific rules to data or data models. These rules can then be tested on sample data to determine how performance, revenue, or growth would be affected.

**4.Interpreting data**

The objective of this step is to first identify insights and correlate them to your data findings. You can then communicate your findings to business leaders or fellow colleagues using charts, dashboards, or reports.
